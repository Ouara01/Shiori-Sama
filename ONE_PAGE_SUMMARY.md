## 💬 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

**"What's your tech stack?"**
> Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5. I chose these because they're industry-standard, well-supported, and production-ready.

**"How do you handle APIs?"**
> I integrated two APIs: AniList GraphQL and Jikan REST. I handle errors, implement fallbacks, and use proper async/await patterns.

**"Why TypeScript strict mode?"**
> Type safety catches bugs at compile-time, improves IDE support, and makes code more maintainable. Industry best practice.

**"How do you stay current?"**
> I use the latest versions of tools (Next.js 16, React 19) and follow the JavaScript/TypeScript community closely.

**"What's your biggest learning?"**
> This project taught me the value of clean architecture. Separating concerns makes code maintainable and scalable.

✅ Instead: "I've already demonstrated these skills"

❌ Don't underestimate your value
✅ Instead: "My market research shows €42-55k for this level"

❌ Don't over-complicated explanations
✅ Instead: Keep it simple and professional

❌ Don't ignore the code
✅ Instead: Know every line of your project

❌ Don't apply to irrelevant jobs
✅ Instead: Target companies using your exact stack
```
